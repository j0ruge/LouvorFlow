# Specification Quality Checklist: Pipeline CI/CD Agnóstico para Organização

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec is agnostic: references "provedor CI/CD", "registry privado", "proxy reverso" instead of specific tools (GitHub Actions, GHCR, nginx-proxy).
- Lessons Learned section references specific repos by name for traceability — this is historical context, not implementation detail.
- The `project-config.md` schema keys (REPO_NAME, PACKAGE_MANAGER, etc.) are domain concepts, not implementation details — they define WHAT needs to be configured, not HOW.
- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
